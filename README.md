# c-fundamentals – Embedded & Systems Programming

This folder contains C programs written and debugged by me during
self-learning and practice to build strong foundations for embedded
and firmware development.

The focus areas include:
- Pointer-based data structures (linked lists)
- Dynamic memory allocation using malloc and calloc
- Structure usage and memory layout
- Bitwise operations and low-level logic

These programs were created as learning exercises and refined through
debugging and experimentation.
