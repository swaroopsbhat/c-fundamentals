## Learning Notes – C & Embedded Fundamentals

### C Language Fundamentals
- Strong understanding of pointers, pointer arithmetic, and memory addressing
- Worked with arrays, strings, and structures
- Implemented linked lists (singly, doubly, circular) using dynamic memory
- Used malloc, calloc, and free for heap memory management
- Debugged segmentation faults and logical errors during development

### Bit Manipulation
- Used bitwise operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>)
- Applied XOR for value swapping without temporary variables
- Performed bit-level modifications on integers
- Understood masking and its importance in low-level programming

### Embedded & Firmware-Oriented Concepts
- Understood how C maps to memory and hardware behavior
- Learned the importance of careful memory handling in systems programming
- Practiced writing code with awareness of performance and memory usage

### Linux & Kernel Learning (Overview)
- Built and loaded Linux kernel modules
- Understood module initialization and cleanup flow
- Used printk and dmesg for kernel debugging
- Learned basics of character device drivers and user-kernel interaction
- Explored concepts such as volatile, MMIO, and register-level programming

### Learning Approach
- Code written as part of self-learning and practice
- Debugged programs manually to understand root causes
- Used reference material and experimentation to improve understanding
